                <div class="answer">
                    We cooperate with leading companies in the field (you can see the list of partners on our website), with many of whom we also have internships from time to time. At the end of our Profession courses, we refer the students who have shown good results to the mentioned organizations, as well as to other organizations that are looking for beginner specialists. However, it should be noted that we can not guarantee employment, it all depends on the result of the student and the final decision is made by the organization.
                    There is an opportunity to have a guaranteed job only at the end of Bootcamp, the details of which you can find at the following link: Bootcamp

                    Do you have individual classes?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    We do not organize individual classes. But let us mention that group lessons are not inferior in efficiency. Moreover, during group discussions, team projects, students reinforce the material learned, gain experience that helps to easily integrate into the work environment.

                    Is English required to participate in the courses?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    The knowledge of English is highly desirable to participate in the courses. Although the lessons are conducted in Armenian, the terminology, the provided literature and the other resources are in English.
                    In addition, English language in the field of IT is unavoidable, which is why English is a prerequisite for becoming a software engineer.

                <div class="answer">
                    Depending on the course, we have online, offline or hybrid classes: theoretical classes (lectures) are held online, and practical classes are held in our classrooms.

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    We believe it’s never too late to start learning, hence we do not have an upper age restriction.
                    But we would like to mention that the courses are quite intensive and are aimed at preparing specialists, so they may be too challenging to access for high school students.
                    In general, we have had both high school students and adults who have participated and successfully completed various courses.
